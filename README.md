# shiny
deployment of rocker-org/shiny and rstudio/shiny-examples

Original code obtained from:

# git clone
I wanted everything to be deployed in the same git clone:
git clone https://github.com/mkimble88/shiny shiny

# volumes
Volumes for apps and logs are linked in the shiny/dockerfile/docker-compose.yml
